## New Mechanisms

There are some creative mechanisms in our version:

- Alliance and Country
- Custom difficulty
- Economic factor(EF)
- Random generated and dynamic map
- Weak plays limit

### Alliance and Country

Two alliances, Asia, America & Europe with four countries respectively.

- Asia: 
	+ China
	+ Japan
	+ India
	+ Russia
- America & Europe: 
	+ United States
	+ Canada
	+ United Kingdom 
	+ Germany

### Custom difficulty

- Easy
- Norm
- Hard

### Economic factor(EF)

System will generate EF randomly every **5** turns.


The range of EF depends on the difficult of the game.  

- For easy model, EF: -5% ~ 5% . 
- For normal model, EF: -10% ~ 10% . 
- For hard model, EF: -15% ~15% .

### Random generated and dynamic map

The map will be randomly generated at the beginning of a game, then after every **5** turns, the blocks will be resorted in the map.

### Weak plays limit

New players can join the game as enterprisers but will be limited on following conditions:

- less than 6 players existing in the current game
- the number of real-estate is larger than 50%

IF both conditions are met, the new players can apply to join the game with the agreement of all current players. And the new player's initial cash depends on original initial cash and the largest amount of toal money enterprisers get from “Start Spot” from game beginning till the turn he/she joins.
