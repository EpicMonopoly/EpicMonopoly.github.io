## New Mechanisms

There are some creative mechanisms in our version:

- Alliance and Country
- Custom difficulty
- Economic factor(EF)
- Random generated and dynamic map
- Weak plays limit

### Alliance and Country

Two alliances, Asia, America & Europe with four countries respectively.

- Asia: 
	+ China
	+ Japan
	+ India
	+ Russia
- America & Europe: 
	+ United States
	+ Canada
	+ United Kingdom 
	+ Germany

### Custom difficulty

- Easy
- Norm
- Hard

### Economic factor(EF)

System will generate EF randomly every **5** turns.


The range of EF depends on the difficult of the game.  

- For easy model, EF: -5% ~ 5% . 
- For normal model, EF: -10% ~ 10% . 
- For hard model, EF: -15% ~15% .
