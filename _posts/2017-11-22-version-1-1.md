We successfully finished almost 95% of the game logic and it works well. Besides, we had big progress on front end. After testing the combination of front end with the back end using Tornado based server, we complete a semi-manufactured product which is near our original design.
We will go on finish this project. Thanks for every members espicially two girls who design all the front end pages.
