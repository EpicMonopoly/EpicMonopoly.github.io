We have redesigned our UML since they are not specified and concrete enough for developers to implemnet the function, also, more details have been added into the file.

The architecture has been talked again and we are considering cancel use database in the original version. 

Hard work has been done today and more tasks will be conducted in near few days. 

Boss said you should be ready on Nov. 23rd, 2017...emmmmï¼Œ JUST KIDDING.
